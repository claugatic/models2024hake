# Hake models for 2024
Site to evaluate models for 2024 in hake. 
Performance and structure testing

## Some new necessary changes 

    1) Don't use catch rate data in model amak.
    2) use data by fleet (from jjm) in amak model.
    3) Is possible a flexible selectivity in amak in some way that jjm.
    4) Improve fit to acoustic in JJM model. 


## Comment
In common hake, different models are being used with both individual fleets and integrated fleets. 
In the coming months, it is necessary to determine which structure is better and assess performance
 through diagnostics, such as retrospective analysis, DIC, likelihood, etc. The model in SS has a poor fit
 to the acoustic data and estimates unrealistically high biomasses. 
 Therefore, there is a desire to explore both the model structure and the platform. 
 The Amak and JJM models are up to date and operational.
 Amak is configured with a single fleet (fishery), while JJM has two fleets.
